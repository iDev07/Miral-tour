                    Tourism dollars support the development of local livelihoods
                    as well as benefit and protect local environment and
                    culture. Travelers and locals behave respectfully towards
                    each other and are able to exchange information and services
                    that mutually benefit both parties. All travelers and tour
                    operators are educated about how to make responsible choices
                    in travel and where they give their money. Tours are
