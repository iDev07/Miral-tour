                        Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan and, concurrently,
                        the largest city in Central Asia. In 2008, the
                        archaeologists announced that the city is already 2,200
                        years old. One of the first mentions of the city was
                        found in the chronicles written in the II century BC. In
                        the ancient Chinese sources, Tashkent was called ‚ÄúShi‚Äù,
                        which means stone, and in the early Middle Ages, Shash
                        or Chach

                          The scientists concluded that the Turkic tribes who
                          settled on this territory later borrowed the name, as
                          ‚Äútash‚Äù in the Turkic languages also translated as
                          stone. Due to its favorable location, the city was
                          considered one of the main points on the Silk Road.

                          history and modern lifestyle are merged. There are two
                          international airports and two railway stations in

                          city is the metro. It was opened in 1977 and was the
                          first and the only in Central Asia. Each station has
                          its own unique design and unique architecture.
